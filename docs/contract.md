# Trawler control contract

Every registered trawler exposes a small typed control surface to `trawl` and
the Mac app. Clients depend on this contract, not on provider archive schemas
or internal trawler packages.

The Go interfaces in `trawlkit/contracts.go` and the protobuf messages under
`trawlkit/proto/trawl` define the same boundary. Go owns execution. Protobuf
owns the records that cross into the CLI, the Mac app and later API clients.

## Command surface

The examples below assume that the CLI executable is in the current directory
as `./trawl`:

```text
./trawl
./trawl --help
./trawl status [TRAWLER] [FLAGS]
./trawl update [TRAWLER ...] [FLAGS]
./trawl replicate --to USER@HOST:/PATH [TRAWLER ...] [FLAGS]
./trawl search [WORDS ...] [FLAGS]
./trawl who NAME [FLAGS]
./trawl conversations [FLAGS]
./trawl messages --conversation LINK [FLAGS]
./trawl open LINK [FLAGS]
./trawl TRAWLER COMMAND [ARGUMENTS] [FLAGS]
```

Root commands combine results from the relevant installed trawlers. A trawler
namespace exposes its own archive commands. A declared namespace-root command
can also run as `./trawl TRAWLER [FLAGS]`. Root help lists all visible commands;
each command's `--help` describes its flags.

The CLI writes human text. The Mac app and other structured clients consume
the shared protobuf messages directly.

## Registry and command declarations

`RegisteredTrawlerManifest` declares:

- the stable trawler identity, command name, display name and aliases;
- the commands shown in the bare `trawl` overview;
- the capabilities implemented by the trawler;
- the trawler privacy boundary; and
- every public trawler command, its arguments, flags and help placement.

The privacy boundary states what the trawler reads, what leaves the Mac and
which network requests it makes. The root CLI and the Mac app read one
registry. It marks each trawler as available or coming soon and keeps names and
ordering consistent.

## Shared typed records

`TrawlerCommandResponse` is a protobuf `oneof`. It carries one direct response:

| Human concept | Protobuf response | Record in the response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| messages | `MessageListResponse` | `MessageRecord` |
| conversations | `ConversationListResponse` | `ConversationRecord` |
| people | `PersonListResponse` or `PersonRecord` | `PersonRecord` |
| calendar events | `CalendarEventListResponse` | `CalendarEventRecord` |
| calendars | `CalendarListResponse` | `CalendarRecord` |
| notes | `NoteListResponse` | `NoteRecord` |
| note folders | `NoteFolderListResponse` | `NoteFolderRecord` |
| recovered note versions | `RecoveredNoteVersionListResponse` | `RecoveredNoteVersionRecord` |
| photos | `PhotoListResponse` | `PhotoRecord` |
| local photo days | `PhotoLocalDayListResponse` | `PhotoLocalDayRecord` |
| photo layer | `PhotoInspectionResponse` | `OpenedPhotoRecord` |

These records carry typed human facts. A message has its time, people and their
roles, text or media description, and conversation context. A conversation has
its name, people, latest activity and unread count. A person has names, contact
methods and contributing trawlers. A calendar event has its name, times,
calendar, place, people and event details.

`OpenRecord` uses another protobuf `oneof` for shared records and bounded
trawler-specific presentation:

- `OpenedMessageRecordWithConversationContext`;
- `ConversationRecord`;
- `PersonRecord`;
- `CalendarEventRecord`;
- `OpenedNoteRecord`;
- `OpenedPhotoRecord`; or
- `TrawlerSpecificOpenedRecordPresentation`.

An opened message includes typed surrounding messages and the conversation
link. This lets a person move from one result to the complete conversation
without adding another trawler argument.

An opened note carries its note and version identities, metadata and an
explicitly available or unavailable body. An available body is complete.

## Typed product projections and bounded plugin presentation

Each trawler owns its provider-native archive, source semantics and private
schemas. Recognised built-in product concepts must cross the client boundary as
concrete TrawlKit protobuf records. Notes now projects note lists, folders,
recovered versions and opened notes into shared note records. Calendar now
projects its calendar catalogue and events into shared calendar records. The
CLI and Mac app can understand these concepts directly without depending on
either provider archive.

Gmail and X still use the generic presentation path. Moving each to a
concrete typed projection is explicit current debt owned by its existing
migration lane, not the intended end state.

Photos search, listing, local days, inspection and CLI open use typed photo
records. The app transport projects opened photo facts into the existing
detail presentation through `trawlkit/render`, which supplies the same labels,
values and order as CLI open. A native photo preview is not implemented.

In the intended end state, the generic `TrawlerSpecificCommandResponse` and
`TrawlerSpecificOpenedRecordPresentation` fallback is reserved for a genuinely
unknown plugin record type that has no recognised TrawlKit record. This
boundary is not fully enforced while the built-in migrations above remain.
Generic messages carry the small typed list or detail content that every client
understands. The provider owns the content and each client owns its layout.
They do not carry the provider record, serialised bytes or a runtime type name.

The CLI currently invokes trawler-specific commands and renders their list or
detail response. The Mac app currently invokes only `status`, `update`,
`search` and `open`. It can render a trawler-specific detail returned by
`open`, but it does not currently invoke trawler-specific commands.

The generic plugin presentation contract is closed. Its values are limited to:

- text;
- an unsigned count;
- a time or calendar date; and
- an internal canonical record reference that TrawlKit converts to a link.

A list has named columns and rows. A detail has a name, named fields and an
optional text body. That is the entire shared presentation contract for
uncommon command output. It presents bounded lists and details; it is not an
arbitrary document language. Provider-native meaning stays with the provider.
The contract contains no `Any`, JSON, generic map, type URL, byte payload,
compatibility alias or second transport path.

## Photos on Apple facts

`trawl search` includes Apple's recognised text, titles, captions, place
levels, named people, albums and moment titles. Each matching fragment names
its original source field and preserves its text and script. A search without
words still applies its date and person filters. Photos matches a resolved
Contacts display name against Apple's named people. Links use the shared short-reference
algorithm over present photos; browsing never creates an index or writes the
archive.

`trawl photos` lists newest photos and accepts `--on`, `--from`, `--to`,
`--place`, `--person`, `--album`, `--camera` and `--favourite`. Date filters
accept `YYYY-MM-DD` in the capture zone; both range endpoints are included.
`--on` cannot be combined with a range. Name filters match Unicode text without
case distinctions. `--place` matches every stored Apple place level, including
the address, areas and country code. Apple's area array retains its source
order, including repeated entries; that order does not imply size. Open and
inspection label this list explicitly as Apple source order. The separate
postal and administrative fields form the camera-place hierarchy. `--limit`
bounds returned rows.

`trawl photos days` groups photos by their known capture-local date. Each row
shows the first and last capture times with offsets and UTC. Repeated towns
are merged; the five most photographed places appear in capture order, with
their region and country when these change and a count of remaining places.
When no town is recorded, the next administrative level is used. `--limit`
bounds days and the More command expands the selection. With a configured known-places file, it also shows a matching
known place or distance from the nearest home valid on that date. Without
configuration, that column is absent. Photos with no known capture zone are
excluded from local-day grouping and reported explicitly.

`trawl open PHOTO` shows an existing card first, then Apple facts, where the
original picture is held and the inspection command. Camera coordinates,
altitude and Apple's horizontal accuracy accompany the camera place. No empty card fields
are shown. `trawl photos inspect PHOTO [LAYER]` defaults to `apple-facts` and
shows labelled human rows for the facts and associated Apple trips, without
internal identifiers or raw enum names. `trawl photos run` retains the exact
protobuf input and output. The remaining
layers (`picture-metadata`, `nearby-places`, `card-model-input`, `card`) name
the step that produces them and state when it has not run. Picture fetching
and those enrichment steps are not built yet.

Capture times use the zone at the standard GPS camera position when known.
Without that position, Apple's recorded device offset is used. When Apple
records only a device zone name, its offset is derived at the capture instant
and identified separately from an offset Apple recorded. Truly unknown zones
are shown in UTC, without assuming this computer's zone.

`trawl photos run read_apple_library --limit N` and `--photo PHOTO` return only
trips containing selected photos. A partial import preserves unrelated stored
photos and trips. Derived search rows are written only for new or changed
source facts. A stale derived archive is rebuilt once from source, outside the
normal operating path. An identical import leaves facts,
trip rows and search-index content unchanged; only last-run bookkeeping advances.

## Status

`TrawlerArchiveStatus` carries three facts:

- archive content counts after the last successful update;
- the exact time of the last successful update; and
- whether the archive can answer its current commands.

The CLI presents these as `app`, `archive`, `last updated` and `works`.
Photos reports the successful Apple-library read independently of later steps
that are not built. Updating Photos refreshes Apple's facts and reports those
unbuilt steps without treating the successful refresh as a failure. Running
an unbuilt step directly exits non-zero and explains that it is not built.
Failures are separate typed operation failures, not extra status text.

## Replication

`replicate` copies trawler archives to another machine the person controls. It
is a copy, never a sync: the replica is written, the Mac is not read back into,
and nothing on the replica host is ever deleted.

The replica is a state root, so every archive keeps its path relative to the
local state root. An archive stored outside that root has nowhere to go and
fails the whole run rather than landing somewhere arbitrary.

Replication holds the same kind of exclusive state-root lock as `update`, so a
copy never reads an archive mid-rewrite. Every dependency is checked before the
first byte moves, because a run that fails halfway leaves the replica holding
a mix of two archives. Each replicated archive is validated on the replica host
before the run is called successful, and the replica keeps the same private
file permissions as the original.

## Search and people

Search remains query-led. It returns evidence matching the query and its
filters rather than a catalogue of every record.

Each `TrawlerSearchMatch` carries:

- the matching record time;
- the trawler name and record kind;
- the human name of the matching record;
- related people and their roles;
- the nearest digital containers and physical places;
- typed text fields split into matching and non-matching fragments; and
- the internal record identity used to assign the public link.

The root search operation assigns the link and combines the matches. The CLI
renders comparable rows ordered by `when`, `match`, useful `who`, `where` and
`what` context, `app`, then the `link`. Matched content gets the spare width.
The CLI omits empty or repeated context.

Search returns the total match count when the trawler knows it, whether that
count is a lower bound and whether more matches exist. `--limit` controls the
number shown. `--after` and `--before` accept dates or times. `--who` resolves a
person to the exact identifiers known by each relevant trawler before search.
A trawler can explicitly declare that it also matches resolved display names.

Person matches carry the display name, useful alternative names, the value that
matched the query, contributing trawlers, message count and link. The CLI uses
message count first when it orders several people.

## Links and open

Every link shown by a root command is globally routable. It contains the
trawler identity and a stable local alias. A person or agent can copy it into
`./trawl open LINK` without selecting the trawler again.

Trawlers keep their canonical record references inside the typed and storage
contracts. TrawlKit assigns and resolves links at the shared boundary. Human
tables show links, not provider database identifiers, and never truncate them.

`open` returns the requested typed record and any bounded context around the
matching item. The response also keeps the requested link and optional anchor
identifier so each client can show the same target in its own layout.

`./trawl calendar calendars` returns a typed catalogue with each calendar's
exact globally routable link. `./trawl calendar events LINK` accepts one of
these links and lists events from that calendar; it does not identify a
calendar by its display name or account name. Calendar links are navigation
links for this command rather than records accepted by root `open`.

Calendar records carry the account and an optional
`CalendarOwnerOrPurposeAnnotation`. This is a user's stated owner or purpose,
not Calendar source data. Its typed provenance includes the
`calendar_owner_or_purpose_description_stated_date`, preserved from the source
`YYYY-MM-DD` value. When present, the annotation also accompanies the
calendar's events in event lists and opened event details, so similarly named
calendars retain their intended context.

## Output and failure rules

- Output is bounded and states when more records exist.
- Human text and protobuf output carry the same facts but use layouts suited to
  each client.
- Protobuf uses typed timestamps and calendar dates. A record time also
  carries the UTC offset where the event happened when the source recorded
  it. Human output shows that local time with its offset and UTC, or UTC alone
  when the source does not know where the event happened.
- Every word of human output is written by `trawlkit/render`. Commands,
  trawlers and the CLI hand it typed values; lint rejects print calls
  anywhere else.
- Secrets, tokens, cookies and credential fragments never appear in output,
  errors or logs.
- A typed failure contains a code and a plain message. Partial operations keep
  successful records and identify the trawlers that did not complete.
- Detailed causes belong in run logs. Human errors do not give repair work to
  the user.
- Read commands use existing local archives and do not change the original
  apps. `update` is the explicit command that gets new items from apps.
- Public commands do not prompt for interactive input.
- Update progress uses typed protobuf events for the Mac app and stderr for the
  CLI.
- `-v` shows detailed progress on stderr. `-vv` adds debug detail.

Process exit codes are stable: `0` means complete, `1` means failed, `2` means
the command was used incorrectly and `3` means a partial result with usable
stdout.
